Multiplatform Application Development student with a multidisciplinary background that combines software development, 3D art, game design and audiovisual communication.  
During my studies and internships I have also worked on AI object detection, API creation, and game development using Unreal Engine and Substance tools.

Before moving fully into programming, I completed a degree in Audiovisual Communication and a Master’s in Videogame Art & Design, developing skills in 3D modeling, shaders, VFX, and Adobe Suite.  
This artistic and technical background gives me a unique profile: I understand both code and visual production, which allows me to collaborate between programming and creative teams.

I’ve worked in different environments — from communication departments to community management, software development and award-winning videogame project — always adapting, learning fast and contributing to team results.
